## Abstract

This project seeks to examine the content on the WallStreetBets (WSB) subreddit on Reddit in order to uncover market trends and investor opinions. We concentrate on important factors like post title, score, number of comments, and post creation time with the WSB posts dataset from Kaggle. Our study covers descriptive statistics, market trends, and investor sentiment analysis using natural language processing methods. The knowledge acquired from this research adds to a more comprehensive comprehension of market trends and the actions of investors, offering important data for investors, analysts, and policymakers.
